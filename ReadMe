This is a simple but complete example of using ANTLR 4.  

The developer creates 3 files: a lexer gramma, a parser grmmmar, and a translator. The ANTLR tool, which is written in Java, 
converts the two gammars to code in the users's choice of programming languages with Java being the default and that is what is done here. 
The  ANTLR tool also generates a template for a translator in the selected language that is consistent with the grammars. The developer then 
manually extends the template as necessary.
